        I’ve longed to write to you in a while, letting you know how I feel
        inside. You gave me everything to make my life glow, and I can’t thank
        you enough for being the sweetest thing in the world. How can I describe
        my feelings for you in this short letter? This space won’t be enough to
        contain everything I feel about you. You keep showing me that in every
        age and any place, true love exists, and I’m so happy to have found you
        when I did. Having you in my world has brought me more satisfaction than
        anything can bring, including money. I can’t thank you enough for
        touching me deeply with the things you do for me. You are the best thing
        that came my way, and I feel alive each time I get to see your lovely
        face again. Have a beautiful day, baby.
      </p>
      <br /><br />

        My love, I wish I am there with you because it’s lonely being here
        without you. I’ve tried to do so many things, but it keeps hitting me
        deep in my heart that I am missing someone so precious.<br />
        The distance is killing me because the ache of missing you for long is
        one hell of a nightmare. You’re striving for a better future. I want the
        best for you too, but if I have my way, I’d be right there by your side
        like your favorite pair of trousers.<br />
        I’ll show you how much I admire you. I’ll give you my whole love because
        it was prepared specially for you. I can’t wait to be in your arms and
        kiss your soft lips when my head can’t think of anything to <br />
        I want to be the best for you so we will have a bright and fantastic
        future together, where the world will watch our love in wonder. I love
        you with all that I am, all that I was and all that I will ever be.
